# FallGuy SafeNet Hardener

A ruthless PowerShell script to slap Microsoft’s telemetry nonsense back into place.

## 🎯 What It Does
- Disables telemetry + media sharing services
- Blocks outbound network calls from common snooper programs (e.g., OneDriveSetup.exe, MsSense.exe)
- Doesn't uninstall, just shuts doors and kills whispers

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. **Run PowerShell as Administrator**
2. Execute:
```powershell
.\FallGuy_SafeNet.ps1

**There are two types of people in the world:**

- 🧼 The Clean — who trust Microsoft, Google, and their toaster.
- 🔒 The Dirty — who know better.

FallGuy SafeNet is named after the kind of person who's *been burned before* — a FallGuy. The poor bastard blamed when a breach happened, or when user data showed up on Reddit, or when the intern downloaded TikTok on the company laptop.

Now, that FallGuy has learned. Hardened. Paranoid. And this is his revenge.

## 🥃 The Philosophy

- **No backdoors. No whispering services. No ghosts at boot.**
- A machine that doesn’t talk is a safe one.
- If you need OneDrive, install it **your way** — not the system’s.
- WMP streaming? Cute. But the FallGuy doesn’t stream. He *rips*.

## 🛡️ Who This Is For

- IT techs who’ve been yelled at one too many times
- Tinfoil sysadmins who write bash scripts in Notepad++
- Anyone who's typed `netstat -anob` and seen something they didn't like

## 🔥 Final Thought

This isn't for normal users.

This is for people who wear headsets to meetings they aren't invited to.

## 🔍 How FallGuy Was Born

> *"Early 2025, I pawned my PC to make rent. When I got it back, I noticed strange files in my OneDrive. Encrypted chunks, renamed binaries, foreign IP logs — none of them mine."*

OneDrive had become a **safe dump** — **my** safe dump — for someone else’s operations.  
Some bastard was using my Microsoft account as a ghost hard drive for sketchy activity.

That’s when I realized:  
> Even if you never open OneDrive… they do.  
> Even if you don’t use the services… they’re running.  
> Even if you don’t stream… your PC might.

FallGuy SafeNet was forged from that violation.

I built it not to break Windows — but to **make it shut the hell up**.

No deletions. No damage. Just closed doors, severed signals, and a polite middle finger to any process that thinks it owns your box.

## 💀 Why Share It?

Because maybe you pawn your PC one day.

Maybe you log in from a hotel WiFi and someone spins up a listener.

Maybe you’re just a broke coder who doesn’t need another fight in his day.

Whatever the reason — **this is your firewall. Your bat signal. Your don’t-mess-with-me button.**

So run it.

And sleep better.
